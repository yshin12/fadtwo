# fadtwo (FActor-Driven TWO-regime regressions)

Last update: 2018-02-22

There are two codes:

  (1) lib_fadtwo.R - the collection of all functions required for estimating the model 
                     model selection is added (2018-02-22)
  
  (2) example_fadtwo.R - an example code for estimting the model without model selection
  
  (3) example_selection_joint.R - an exmaple code for model selection using the joint algorithm
  
  (4) example_selection_iter.R - an exmpale code for model selection using the iterative algorithm
  
  (5) dat_rz.dat - a data file for Ramey and Zubeira (2017)
  
  (6) rz_fadtwo.R - for estimating the RZ model without model selection
  
  (7) rz_selection_joint.R - for estimating the RZ model with model selection; joint method
  
  (8) rz_selection_iter.R - for estimating the RZ model with model selection; iterative method
