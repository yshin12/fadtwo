# fadtwo (FActor-Driven TWO-regime regressions)

Last update: 2018-02-03

There are two codes:

  (1) lib_fadtwo_selection.R - the collection of all functions required for implementing the model selection procedure. This library is not fully integrated to the existing library, 'lib_fadtwo.R', so I put a different name for it. 
  
  (2) sim-000.R - simulation file. All three files are different only in p=0, 1, 2, and gamma value in dgp1 accordingly.
  
  (3) sim-001.R
  
  (4) sim-002.R
